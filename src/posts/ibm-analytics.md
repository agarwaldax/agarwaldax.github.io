The final shipped version of the homepage

## Background

IBM Cloud Pak for Data is IBM’s analytics platform. It is built on React and Redux and uses IBM’s open source Carbon Component library. Right now, the homepage is not very useful to users and needs a redesign. The existing homepage is glitchy, performs poorly, and isn’t responsive.
